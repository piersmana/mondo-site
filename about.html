                    <h3>We bring patients relief through healthy and delicious medicinal products.</h3>
                    <p>The original inspiration for MONDO was the need for daily pain relief, and fulfilling that need continues to be our guiding principle. Using expert culinary knowledge and an uncompromising dedication to quality, we are continuously developing nutritious new artisanal recipes to satisfy every taste.</p>
                    <h3>We advance the industry by demonstrating the value of socially-conscious practices.</h3>
                    <p>From our organic, locally-sourced ingredients to our 100% compostable packaging, MONDO is a leader in environmental stewardship and conscious consumption. With our "patients first" philosophy, we hope to serve as a successful model for other organizations that prioritize responsibility over profit.</p>
                    <h3>We seek to help more patients by investing in sustainable growth.</h3>
                    <p>Even as MONDO expands to new states and markets, we are committed to preserving our products' signature quality. Through ongoing equipment and process improvements, we are building an organization that will provide medicine to an ever-growing number of patients for many years to come.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>In 2010, Emily O'Brien suffered a critical back injury that left her nearly incapacitated. Her 6-month recovery required prescription painkillers, which caused such bad nausea that Emily needed cannabis to be at all functional.</p>
                    <p>Because of her asthma and other health concerns, Emily relied on edible cannabis products to medicate. Unfortunately, she found that the sugary, dessert-like edibles on the market brought on additional problems, including weight gain that further aggravated her injury.</p>
                    <p>When Washington state voted to allow recreational cannabis use in 2012, Emily was inspired to make a healthy medicated product designed for patients like herself. With the help of her business class at Evergreen State College, she perfected the recipe for a granola bar that helped manage pain without sacrificing healthiness.</p>
                    <p>On November 21st, 2013, MONDO products launched in Washington for medical patients. Two years later, over 23,000 MONDO products have been sold. With MONDO's upcoming expansion to California, we look forward to helping even more patients manage their conditions soon!</p>
